Name: Justin Vesche

Feedback: Overall it was a little strange creating a linked list without the use of pointers. At first I thought the project was going 
to be much harder than it was. However, after digging into the first couple methods the project wasn't as bad as I'd expected. Also,
I was a bit rusty using python so some syntax didn't come to me right away.

Time Took: I started the project 1/14 and ended 1/15. The first day I worked about 5 hours and the second I worked for a little over
an hour. So the project took a little over 6 hours in total.

Resources: The only resources I used concerned syntax in python and zyBooks for the use of lists and link-lists.

For syntax I used the following: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp
	(I got mixed up with different language syntax like C++ and java)

For understanding link-lists graphically I used the following:
